This is a classic, Avenues home perched in the top of said neighborhood, and the location lends itself to everything good. Think: biking, hiking, running, snow-shoeing, cross-country skiing, and sledding...all essentially right out your back door. And still, despite all that nature being so very within your reach, you'd still also be five minutes from downtown SLC. The home itself is a designer's own, complete with extensive millwork and features that go well 'above and beyond.' Brazilian cherry staircases, two-story windows, Juliette balconies that overlook the foyer, pocket French doors, and stained-glass windows are just a few of the fineries that speak to a good eye and better living. Oversized walls, alcoves, and columns harken to a time past (but no less desired), and the pond and waterfall lead right to the doorstep for a most welcoming feeling. Concrete floors throughout feature radiant heat and finishes that feel as warm as the aforementioned Brazilian cherry, and the open flow of the home lends itself to entertaining with ease. Just a few other features worth noting: RV parking, an oversized 3rd bay in the heated garage, plenty of off-street parking, movie room, weight room, and a two-bedroom mother-in-law apartment that you would be happy to live in yourself. And we can't go out without mentioning that charming, wrap-around porch--seems like the perfect place for your favorite blanket, a cup of coffee, and some good conversation. Let's talk.

Built in 1882, this French European home was fully remodeled under the design of Renovation Design Group and executed by Russell & Co and VB Custom Homes. The wood frame home features all new, plumbing, electrical, drywall, finishes and paint with crown molding, can lights and ceiling fans throughout. Stainless steel appliances highlighted by an 8 burner Wolf stove top compliment the traditional cabinetry designed by Craftsman Kitchens of Salt Lake. The brick back splash and 6mm granite counters serve in contrast to the coffered ceiling, with ceiling fans, in this traditionally styled kitchen flanked by a mudroom with custom storage lockers, walk in pantry and built in storage cabinets. The master bedroom features memory foam carpet pads, built in his/hers closets as well as a full 4 piece bathroom. His and hers furniture style vanities are paired with a walk-in shower and original claw foot soaking tub. A craft room on the 2nd level brings the laundry upstairs along with a utility sink and shower. Custom cabinets by Ted Van Buren include a movable island are made to feature with the amount of natural light brought in from the windows and skylight. The basement is fully finished with a kitchen with 10ft ceilings, 2 bedrooms, a full bathroom, laundry and a dedicated outside entrance. Would make an excellent separate living space for someone. Historical elements like the hand-carved newel post, the original main level windows and the quarter sawn tiger oak fireplace were all preserved to retain the homes place in history. Even the slate tile roof was reclaimed from the Catholic Church of the Madeline in 1980. Every home in the avenues is a unique, must see but few come along that blend modern design with Utah history so well, something you really have to see to believe.

Stunning black quartz counter tops glisten off crisp white cabinetry, large walk-in pantry is stellar. As for the rest of the main floor, it's, as Goldie Locks said, ""just right"". Master suite is roomy, has views and walk-in closet. Bath is out of Dwell magazine - floating cabinets, dual sinks, Euroglass shower flanked by large soaking tub. Come relax here. Feel the exhale. 2nd bedroom boasts walk-in closet, too, and an en suite bathroom as well. Top all that off with laundry and a half-bath for guests - it's perfection. Downstairs has a cozy theater room with full wet bar & fridge, wired for surround sound, and the projector is included. Large windows make this part of the home inviting. As for the 50% unfinished basement, that's yours to do with as you wish. It can accommodate 2-3 bedrooms & is stubbed for 2 baths plus storage. Finish it as you like - home gym, office, etc., or keep it simple like these owners have. Oversized 3-car garage holds all of the outdoor toys you have and the yard is just enough space to enjoy. Owners have a full set of plans to expand finished yard out back, which they will share with any interested party, otherwise, enjoy the natural beauty of the hillside behind you. All of this with SLC's best views to the west and south of our valley is just waiting for you to take it all in.","Asphalt Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Washington","Bryant","West","","","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected","Call Agent/Appt; Key Box: Electronic","0.0","","","","","00/00/0000","","","0","","UT","Active","DR","SANDHURST","Rambler/Ranch","0","DORCHESTER POINTE","08-25-426-026","6492","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","3.00","2","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","3,589","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Shades","00/00/0000","2013","84103","","08/24/2016"

The heady mix of architecture and design from varied eras, the decadent city views, and those walkable tree-lined streets had us at ""hello."" Being one of the most coveted areas of our city and all, we know we're not alone in our sentiment. It's a rare soul lucky enough to live in this magical little intersection between Marmalade and The Avenues, and when a property comes to market, the price tag can often be a bit of a shock. Until now, that is. This adorable condo isn't just affordable...it's as move-in ready as they come. In fact, this one's had a fantastic remodel, and the furniture is even for sale for an easy-breezy moving experience. Cement floors and a white tile backsplash in the kitchen make for an industrial artist-studio vibe, neatly juxtaposed by hardwood floors throughout the rest of the home. Roomy bedroom with plenty of well-designed storage space, and don't let the tidy square footage here deter you. The kitchen, primary living space, and good size balcony are all aligned just so...making for the perfect party space, should you decide to invite over a few of your close ones. For the java addicted, Alchemy Coffee is just around the corner, as is the adjoined Em's Restaurant for some seriously good eats. Memory Grove–with its beautiful trails and jogging paths–is a short walk away, as is the Capitol Building (oh, so lush).

Located between 4th & 5th Avenue, the owner has preserved or restored much of the original character of the beautiful hardwoods, fireplace, stained glass, and vintage charm.  A rear addition added a family room on the main and additional living space to the second floor.  The second floor offers two bedrooms, each with living or office space adjacent and two separate staircases. The lower level has two apartments, one legal and one non-conforming. Each apartment has its own kitchen, full bath, living area and separate access. Apartments are currently NOT rented and most recently housed family members. The garage in back has been used as the owners workshop. Recent upgrades include greenhouse windows. Low e windows, a HE HVAC heating/cooling system for the second floor.

With uncompromised craftsmanship throughout, you don't need to know a lot about remodeling to know that each room was professionally upgraded. The home has an ambience that clamors for the entertaining of family and guests, and a feeling of warmth and coziness. The upstairs unfolds with three large bedrooms and two baths, one bath with double sinks, and a large master walk-in closet that could pass as a fourth bedroom. Walk out the French doors onto a deck that faces the east and enjoy beautiful mountains and natural shade from fully grown trees. The front of the house has an exquisite entryway, with original woodwork and flooring throughout. The large front porch invites friends to sit and enjoy cool breezes and company. All this, safely surrounded by a beautiful wrought iron fence. Sellers are downgrading to something smaller but are remaining in the neighborhood they love so much.

You just can't beat this downtown location! This charming historic home sits on a quiet tree-lined street near all that downtown Salt Lake City has to offer.   Built in 1898, but extensively remodeled to suit modern living.  It has absolutely perfect finish levels that blend the antique original cabinetry, hardwood floors and fireplace with brand new modern cabinets, appliances and a spacious open floor plan great for entertaining. It's full of light and has a warmth and charm that only a turn of the century 2 story home could ever have. The brand new kitchen is loaded with granite counter tops, stainless steel, and elegant cabinetry. This classic house also offers an exterior covered porch with a gated, private, and landscaped courtyard and a large master bedroom with double bay windows. The home is really a gem!  Best of all, it's only a short walking distance to all of the downtown businesses and attractions. No more need to fight traffic to go to work, City Creek, Abravanel Hall, Capitol Theater, Vivint Smart Home Arena, Temple Square or just out to enjoy the nightlife with family and friends. Ideal for a young professional, but plenty big enough for a small family.

With a bedroom on the main floor and 4 (yes, 4!) bedrooms on the second floor, there's plenty of room for family and guests. Plus, there's additional space in the walk-out basement for large family room or mother-in-law apartment. Updates in baths and kitchen have been tastefully made to accent the original character. Located on A street, which is close enough to downtown to really feel connected to the city. We could mention everything it's close to, but it's A street in the Aves....It goes without saying.  The large front porch is perfect for you and a few guests to enjoy the beauty of the front landscaping complete with water feature.  The backyard patio is off the kitchen and perfect for dinner with friends-there's even space for raised-bed gardening.

This style of home is most commonly found along the eastern seaboard, where English influence was concentrated, so to stumble upon one of these stunners right here in our own fair city is...well, breathtaking. In the midst of the trendy newcomers and staid all-too-commons, this one will appeal to both folks from easterly climes and those of you who have just admired the stately architecture when you vacationed back east. The Georgian style (named for that numerous succession of English kings we know so well) gained popularity upon arrival in the colonies, as it was translated into countless variations that all shared the classic elements. Details like the center-entry façade, two-room-deep center-passage floor plan (with windows aligned horizontally and vertically), paired chimneys, cornice with dentil moulding, and five-bay façade (among many others) remain intact and beautifully representative of the style here. And to these more traditional elements, you can add a gracious family room, sun room, 3-car garage, beautiful back courtyard, tiered garden (with your very own apricot tree and raspberry patch), and perfectly landscaped water-feature. Oh, and that theater room in the basement? Well, just pop on a flick set in New England–we're thinking Mystic Pizza–and you'll be gazing at Georgians from a Georgian (so meta). By George, this might be your home.     Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.

Consider this–you'll be living on G Street, just a stone's throw from City Creek Canyon, some of our favorite restaurants/coffee shops, and you'll have city and valley views, to boot. Not a bad gig. The home was completely remodeled in 2014, and the current owners have added love and pride of ownership...two highly necessary components to creating the perfect space. The open-concept kitchen is one of our favorite features in here, and that dining room will clearly make for the very spot that everyone wants to hang. You'll be surrounded by picture windows that peek out onto the lush, green back yard (boasting seclusion and privacy, thankyouverymuch). And, in a rare turn, the downstairs living space is as comely as the upper floor. Complete with a wet bar, more (above ground) picture windows and plenty of cozy places to relax. Attached garage has a nice little mud room, and that yard is fully-fenced and ready for a pup (or not). Simply put, we've got a show stopper here in a killer location. Be a shame to hesitate too long...*wink.  Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.  Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement and verify all listing information.","Asphalt Shingles","No","Salt Lake","Ensign","Bryant","West","","Judge Memorial","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Connected","Appt/Use Key Box; Key Box: Electronic","0.0","","","","","00/00/0000","","","0","05/24/2016","UT","Under Contract","ST","G","Bungalow/Cottage","0","AVENUES","09-31-235-010","3896","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","4","3.00","3","0","0","2","1","1","1","1","0","0","2,485","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Part","00/00/0000","1939","84103","RES","05/24/2016"

The original owner commissioned the home (from one Georgius Young Cannon–architect of the Springville Carnegie Library, the Beehive House Restoration, and this stunning home) for his British bride, in the hopes of gifting her a bit of England in her new stateside home. The resulting space is the embodiment of a ""storybook cottage"". Particular rooms we die for: the entryway landing, the kitchen (a modestly-sized number, completely remodeled by the current owners, that functions flawlessly in the space), and the main living area (with original, raked-cement cathedral ceilings, and a stunning fireside). If we had to choose a fourth favorite room, it would undeniably be the cutting garden off the front of the house (with roses and peonies accessible by kitchen windows through September). And the fifth, if we had to, would be the backyard. The sensational, fully-landscaped backyard (all three tiers of it) faces west, affording those within it not only smashing sunset views, but views of the Capitol building, the Salt Lake Temple, and all of downtown, as well. Nooks, crannies, and an air of timelessness abound in this garden, which has been maintained since the home was built, nearly 100 years ago. The home is historic from the exterior, but the finishes, craftsmanship, and styling are unparalleled. The roof, boiler, and front and back decks are all brand new; the tiles in the kitchen (imported from a monastery in France), the pantry's hidden subzero drawer, and the wood-burning stove in the sunroom are all thoughtfully-fitting additions, too. The solid wood doors, leaded glass windows, and Japanese maple out back, however, are all original, and stand as true testaments to the timelessness of good style. It's a quiet elegance, here, and precisely the sort of house we live to love. Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only and were obtained from county record .  Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement.

The morning sun bounces from the glass to the fresh creamy walls and onto the honey-glazed wooden floors. Your garden tub beckons as you glide up the stairway to your master suite, where the soothing, bubbling water surrounds you as you contemplate your day. Aromas of baking bread will invite you into the bakery for your first stop. Then, it's off to find some treasures at the shops around the corner before you meet up with friends for lunch at one of the restaurants nearby. Unwinding from your day, the balcony is the perfect spot as the barbecue grill is preparing your evening meal. Kick off your shoes and put up your feet as the sun sets over the city and you relax in anticipation of another marvelous day. Highlights include new carpet, tile, countertops, sinks, faucets, hardware, refrigerator, furnace, air conditioning, air filter, humidifier, 50-gallon water heater, interior light fixtures, window flashings, long-life garage door springs, and garage door opener.","Asphalt Shingles","Yes","Salt Lake","Ensign","Bryant","West","","Rowland Hall-St Mark's","Gas: Connected; Power: Connected; Sewer: Connected; Water: Connected","Call Agent/Appt","0.0","","","","","00/00/0000","","","0","","UT","Active","ST","E","Townhouse; Row-end","0","ENSIGN PLACE PUD","09-31-253-028","3000","Cash; Conventional","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","3","3.00","2","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","2,016","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","Blinds; Full","00/00/0000","1998","84103","1205","07/11/2016"

From the street, this space is striking (and keep-your-eyes-on-the-road at its most hazardous). A towering, modern masterpiece, the hillside home has been lovingly crafted from the ground up. That is to say, it's completely custom. Looking for cookie cutter? Keep walkin'. From the entry (a massive, pivoting door of steel and redwood slats), you're warmly welcomed into a standing ovation-worthy entryway. Vaulted ceilings, windows, and a floor-to-ceiling limestone wall that transitions from outside to in swimmingly. The wall of windows (energy-efficient, no less) opens almost completely, making the living room and back patio one fabulously fluid space. The aforementioned floor-to-ceiling limestone wall, which appears again in the living room, spills out onto the patio and continues along the exterior of the home (continuity at its finest, people). This is indoor/outdoor living oriented around one central gathering space. An entertainer's reverie, the kitchen stands alone as a work of pitch-perfect craftsmanship. The marble countertop was procured from a quarry in Florence, and the result is nothing short of transcendent–but it's the custom backsplash that undoubtedly steals the show. The cabinets and closets are forged from wood salvaged from an old water tower at Kennicott, meaning they're riddled with watermarks, mineral lines, and nail and screw impressions. Essentially: they're perfectly imperfect. Perfectly perfect, though, is the street which this saintly structure sits on. Quiet, cozy, and with city views you wouldn't dream of shaking a stick at. Add a drool worthy backyard (and the totally hidden-from-plain sight pool) and it's all urban oasis. Call it ""organic glam."" Call it ""killer views + total privacy."" Call us up. Then call it ""home.""  Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only and were obtained from appraisal.  Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement.","Aluminum; Metal; Pitched","No","Salt Lake","Wasatch","Bryant","West","","Rowland Hall-St Mark's","Gas: Available; Gas: Connected; Power: Available; Power: Connected; Sewer: Available; Sewer: Connected; Sewer: Public; Water: Available; Water: Connected","See Remarks; Agent Has Key","0.0","","","","","00/00/0000","","","0","08/11/2016","UT","Active","ST","VIRGINIA","Other/See Remarks","0","","09-33-302-014","13957","Cash; Conventional; FHA; VA","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","6","6.00","5","1","0","2","4","1","1","2","0","0","8,000","0","","","Culinary","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","See Remarks; Blinds; Draperies; Full; Shades","00/00/0000","2013","84103","R-2","08/27/2016"

This knockout underwent a two-year, down-to-the-studs remodel that ultimately ended in what we see as an exquisite taste of minimalist bliss. It's seated squarely at the eastern end of a cul-de-sac, thereby pushed snugly against a previously-thought-unusable hillside acre–which the renovation proved extremely usable with the build and inclusion of a beautiful, private, sleek-as-hell black-bottom pool [it's perched on a platform that just happens to be perfect for sunset viewing]. A few choice details: a main bath of which dreams are made, deliciously rich hardwood floors, a private deck off the main suite with dizzying city views, an open closet the size of a small apartment, and square foot after square foot of notably clean design. The new owner took the top floor's existing three beds/two baths and turned them into one large space [vive la wall-less revolution!], and we welcome his views on ""fewer bedrooms, more open space"" as eagerly as we welcomed him to our COLLECTIVE family. According to the contractor, the remodel was ""a design build project that required a ton of demolition; almost all of the plumbing and electrical was replaced, and much of the mechanical was rerouted. We put a 35′ steel beam on the third floor to open the kitchen, we moved walls, moved all the bathrooms, replaced all the flooring, cabinetry, paint, doors, and lighting."" And the result is an ocular orchestra of clean lines and wide-open space. The home is a labor of love: a true feat in design and ingenuity taken on by one of our dearest COLLECTIVE clients, a few of our very own, and a very talented team of artisans. Modern and spacious in a quiet 'hood on the hill? Oh, it's real. And it's spectacular.   Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only.
